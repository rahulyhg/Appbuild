# Shared folders strategy, possible values are 'self' or 'subdirectory'.
# 'self'         => share this project root with the VM (i.e. "Vagrantfile" is shared),
#                   this strategy is perfect to host a single project in your VM (i.e. the vagrant is included in the project)
# 'subdirectory' => share only a subdirectory of this project root (i.e. "Vagrantfile" is not shared),
#                   this strategy is perfect to host multiple projects in your VM (i.e. the vagrant is outside of the projects)
